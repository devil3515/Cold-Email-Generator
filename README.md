â”œâ”€â”€ app.py  # Main Streamlit app
â”œâ”€â”€ chains.py  # Handles job extraction and email generation using Groq LLM
â”œâ”€â”€ portfolio.py  # Loads portfolio data and matches it with job descriptions
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt  # Required Python libraries
â””â”€â”€ utils.py  # Utility for cleaning scraped text
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/devil3515/Cold-Email-Generator.git
cd Cold-Email-Generator
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment for dependency management.

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
myenv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
All required libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following:

```
groq_api_key=YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY` with your actual API key from Groq.

### 5. Prepare Portfolio Data
Update the `resource/my_portfolio.csv` file with your tech stack and portfolio links. It should contain two columns:
- **Techstack**: Skills you have experience in.
- **Links**: Portfolio or project links showcasing your expertise in the respective tech stack.

### 6. Run the Application
Once everything is set up, you can run the app using Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage
1. **Enter Job URL**: Input the URL of the job posting you want to target.
2. **Submit**: Click the submit button to scrape the job description and match your skills with the job.
3. **Generated Cold Email**: The app will display a tailored cold email that you can send to the employer.
